# spotify-api
Unfortunately I could't finish the assignment.
As far as I know from testing everything works fine (not including the bonus materials), 
except that I couldn't figure out how to scope data to a specific user. So now all the data needs authorizations.
I did get the songs only to display that match the playlist id. I hope that counts for something..
I spent a lot of time on this, so I didn't get the chance to try the bonus materials.
What also didn't help was that the website with the sequelize docs was down today.
I'm looking forward to hearing what the solution to my problem is.
